# Untitled Adventure/Factory Voxel Game

AKA ***[Litecraft](https://github.com/halotroop/LiteCraft): Take 3***

AKA ***Codename: BrightCraft***

A fork of @Falkreon's [GlowTest](https://github.com/falkreon/GlowTest)
(Thanks, man! I hate writing the basics!),

## Goals
 - Work **alone** on a project for once in my life
   - Seriously. Working with others is really stressful.
   - I hear that unassisted self-teaching is a really great way to learn.
 - Make a voxel sandbox game, inspired by the most fun ways to play Minecraft
   - Gameplay focussed around adventure OR automation
     - Adventure mode would force players to keep moving,
        adding difficulty in every update as players find clever workarounds
     - Factory mode would encourage players to stay in one place
        and automate every game mechanic
     - Other than incentives, all features would be available in both modes
     - No cheater/creative mode! Force players to prototype their stuff in real-time!
    - Internal focus around modularity
       - Adding things to the game should be super simple. As little as one line of code.
 - Have fun
    - My life is going horribly. I hope this makes it feel better.
    - Might spice it up with some queer/furry stuff some time down the line.

## Decisions, decisions...
 - Render engine:
   - [x] Use someone else's open-source engine
     - Saves time (oh my god I have had enough of writing boilerplate LWJGL code!)
     - Potential to be a lot better than what I could write
   - [ ] Use my own open-source engine
     - Saves me from having to learn someone else's codebase
     - Prevents potential interaction with other developers
     - If N*tch can do it, any idiot could!
