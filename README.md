# Untitled Adventure/Factory Voxel Game

AKA ***[Litecraft](https://github.com/halotroop/LiteCraft): Take 3***

AKA ***Codename: com.halotroop.brightcraft.BrightCraft***

## Goals
 - Work **alone** on a project for once in my life
    - Seriously. Working with others is really stressful.
    - I hear that unassisted self-teaching is a really great way to learn.
 - Make a voxel sandbox game, inspired by the most fun ways to play Minecraft
    - Gameplay focussed around adventure OR automation
        - Adventure mode would force players to keep moving,
        adding difficulty in every update as players find clever workarounds
        - Factory mode would encourage players to stay in one place
        and automate every game mechanic
        - Other than incentives, all features would be available in both modes
        - No cheater/creative mode! Force players to prototype their stuff in real-time!
    - Internal focus around modularity
        - Adding things to the game should be super simple. As little as one line of code.
 - Have fun
    - My life is going horribly. I hope this makes it feel better.
    - Might spice it up with some queer/furry stuff some time down the line.

## Decisions, decisions...
 - Render engine:
     - [x] Use someone else's open-source engine
        - Saves time (oh my god I have had enough of writing boilerplate LWJGL code!)
        - Potential to be a lot better than what I could write
     - [ ] Use my own open-source engine
        - Saves me from having to learn someone else's codebase
        - Prevents potential interaction with other developers
        - If N*tch can do it, any idiot could!

 Undecided. Probably something based on the render engine I use. <br/>

 I want to use licensed music from indie artists. That will probably have its own licensing notice.
